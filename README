NAME
    SHARYANTO - SHARYANTO's temporary namespace for various libraries

VERSION
    version 0.01

FAQ
  What is this? Why SHARYANTO::*?
    The SHARYANTO namespace is used by me for temporary placeholder for
    modules that are either alpha quality, unstable, lacking tests and/or
    documentation, or that haven't found a proper name yet.

    I put such modules on CPAN because some of my other modules (and
    scripts) depend on it.

    To reiterate, this namespace is for temporary placeholder and not for
    vanity :)

    I encourage other authors to do the same.

  Why not something like Tmp::<CPAN ID>::*?
    I haven't decided on what is the best name to use for the "Tmp" part. It
    should be slightly better, in theory.

SEE ALSO
    Alt (where there will similarly be subdivided by CPAN ID's, like
    Alt::INGY::*, Alt::SHARYANTO::*, etc) is slightly different in nature.
    It is for alternate implementation and does not imply a temporary
    nature.
